# GBIF-Geographical-Coordinates-Scraper

A simple program I made to scrape the coordinates of particular species from the [gbif](https://www.gbif.org/). The species could be found in the `sources.xlsx` Excel file.
When this program is executed, an Excel file called `scraped-results.xlsx` is created, which contains the species in the extracted from the `source.xlsx` plus their Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) in Cameroon.
